# Roboflow Object Tracking Example

Object tracking using Roboflow Inference API and Zero-Shot (CLIP) Deep SORT. Read more in our
[Zero-Shot Object Tracking announcement post](https://blog.roboflow.com/zero-shot-object-tracking/).

Example object tracking courtesy of the [Roboflow Universe public Aquarium model and dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/brad-dwyer/aquarium-combined). You can adapt this to your own dataset on Roboflow or any pre-trained model from [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com).

# Overview

Object tracking involves following individual objects of interest across frames. It
combines the output of an [object detection](https://blog.roboflow.com/object-detection) model
with a secondary algorithm to determine which detections are identifying "the same"
object over time.

Previously, this required training a special classification model to differentiate
the instances of each different class. In this repository, we have used
[OpenAI's CLIP zero-shot image classifier](https://blog.roboflow.com/clip-model-eli5-beginner-guide/)
to create a universal object tracking repository. All you need is a trained object
detection model and CLIP handles the instance identification for the object tracking
algorithm.

# Getting Started

## Training your model

To use the Roboflow Inference API as your detection engine:

Upload, annotate, and train your model on Roboflow with [Roboflow Train](https://docs.roboflow.com/train).
Your model will be hosted on an inference URL.

To use YOLOv5 as your detection engine:

Follow Roboflow's [Train YOLOv5 on Custom Data Tutorial](https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-train-yolov5-on-a-custom-dataset/)

## Performing Object Tracking

Clone repositories

```
git clone https://github.com/roboflow-ai/zero-shot-object-tracking
cd zero-shot-object-tracking
git clone https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git CLIP-repo
cp -r ./CLIP-repo/clip ./clip             // Unix based
robocopy CLIP-repo/clip clip\             // Windows
```

Install requirements (python 3.7+)

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install requirements (anaconda python 3.8)
```
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch
conda install ftfy regex tqdm requests pandas seaborn pyyaml
pip3 install opencv-python
```

Yolov4 Requirements
```bash
pip3 install tensorflow easydict
```

Run with Roboflow

```bash

python clip_object_tracker.py --source data/video/cards.mp4 --url https://detect.roboflow.com/playing-cards-ow27d/1 --api_key ROBOFLOW_API_KEY --info
```

Run with YOLOv5
```bash

python clip_object_tracker.py --weights models/yolov5s.pt --source data/video/cars.mp4 --detection-engine yolov5 --info

```

Run with YOLOv4
```bash
# Download YOLOv4 weights from the following link and paste them in the ./data folder
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cewMfusmPjYWbrnuJRuKhPMwRe_b9PaT

# Convert darknet weights to tensorflow model
python save_model.py --model yolov4 

# Run Zero-Shot DeepSORT on video with yolov4 weights
python clip_object_tracker.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-416 --source data/video/cars.mp4 --detection-engine yolov4 --info

```
(by default, output will be in runs/detect/exp[num])
